# Mortar architect

"Mortar provides a simplified, composable overlay for the Android lifecycle, to aid in the use of Views as the modular unit of Android applications." (quote from Mortar)  

Architect provides a flexible stack for displaying and organising the flow of the couple View <> Mortar scope. In architect, these are designated by stack scopes.

Stack scope is basically a class used by Architect to build and configure a mortar scope. It is where you would also build the injection graph. See an example that setups a mortar scope with a dagger2 component and a module.

```java

public class HomeStackScope implements StackScope {

    private final String name;

    public HomeStackScope(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public Services withServices(MortarScope parentScope) {
        return new Services().with(DaggerService.SERVICE_NAME, DaggerHomeStackScope_Component.builder()
                .component(parentScope.<MainActivity.Component>getService(DaggerService.SERVICE_NAME))
                .module(new Module())
                .build());
    }

    @dagger.Module
    public class Module {

        @Provides
        @DaggerScope(Component.class)
        public HomePresenter providesPresenter() {
            return new HomePresenter(name);
        }
    }

    @dagger.Component(dependencies = MainActivity2Component.class, modules = Module.class)
    @DaggerScope(Component.class)
    public interface Component {
        void inject(HomeView view);
    }
}
```


## Navigator

`Navigator` is the class that handles the navigation between scopes. The API is similar to Flow library, but under the hood the implementation is very different.

Each `Navigator` is associated to a delegate class that you must hook up on the container lifecycle. Usually it's the root activity, but it can also be a ViewPresenter if you want to have sub-navigation somewhere else.  
See the calls on `Navigator.delegate()` in the `MainActivity` class, in the example project.

With architect, the navigation is made between `StackPath` classes. `StackPath` is the link between a stack scope and a view. It is also parcelable (using parcelableplease), in order to be persisted and restored in the savedInstanceState bundle when Android kills the app process because of low memory.  
Because `StackPath` classes are boring boilerplate, architect provides an annotation processor **auto-path** that generates paths classes automatically. Apply `@AutoPath` on a `StackScope` class, and voil√†.

Once you have your path class, push it to navigator: `Navigator.get(context).push(new HomePath("Hello lukasz"));`


## Auto stack

Auto-stack is another annotation library. It generates `StackScope` classes that configure dagger2 component. It's another step in the goal of reducing the boilerplate code to the minimum.

By annotating a view presenter with `@AutoStack`, it will genereate for you the `StackScope` class, with its dagger2 component and module. You can use it together with `@AutoPath` to generate also the `StackPath`.

For the dagger2 component and module generation, `@AutoStack` relies on Auto dagger2 project.

If you want to pass parameters from one presenter to another, annotate the presenter constructor param with `@StackParam`, and generated stack scope and stack path classes will take it in account.

```java

// it will generate:
// - SlidePageScope
// - SlidePagePath
@AutoStack(
    component = @AutoComponent(dependencies = MainActivity.Component.class),
    path = @AutoPath(withView = SlidePageView.class)
)
@DaggerScope(SlidePagePresenter.class)
public class SlidePagePresenter extends ViewPresenter<SlidePageView> {

    private final int id;

    public SlidePagePresenter(@StackParam int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```


## Commons

Architect-commons provides some base classes to work with architect stack. See the example project.
